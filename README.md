# Mechanical Keypad


Wanted to design a soundboard/streamdeck instead of buying one. The design made in Fusion 360, code in Arduino IDE and hardware is an Arduino Micro with USB-C.

Turned out great but i want to make the next version with potentiometers to be able to adjust volume for diffrent programs.
